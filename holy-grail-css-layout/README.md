## Project Overview

In this video tutorial, you will build the [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)) CSS Layout using CSS Grid.

You can see the [final version here](https://zachgoll.github.io/holy-grail-css-layout/).

You can see the solution to this challenge on the [Github Pages branch](https://github.com/zachgoll/holy-grail-css-layout/tree/gh-pages) of this repository.

This is part of my [#fullstackroadmap series](https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/2021/fullstack-developer-series/introduction/), which will take you from a complete beginner (no coding experience) to deploying your first full-stack E-Commerce app with ReactJS.

## Instructions

To build this, you will need two things:

- [YouTube Video]() (coming soon) - I suggest watching this video _at least_ until you complete the layout of this design.
- [Style Guide](./style-guide.md) - Here, you will find fonts, colors, and other style resources to assist you while building.
